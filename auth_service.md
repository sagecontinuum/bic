#### Lead: [Wolfgang Gerlach](mailto:wolfgang@uchicago.edu)

### Overview:
The Authorization Service manages permissions of each object hosted by SAGE. 

### Goal:
Support user groups, object groups and sharing of private objects.

### Implementation Notes:

A primitive authorization service has been implemented as a [MySQL table](https://github.com/sagecontinuum/sage-storage-api/blob/master/init.sql).
