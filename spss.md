# Sage Public Streaming Service (SPSS)


#### Lead: Wolfgang Gerlach

### Overview:

Near real-time sensor data can be used to trigger different kinds of actions. A 
streaming service provides fast and efficient access to sensor data and thus would 
  * enable Sage functions to listen for certain events e.g. change the behavior of other edge plugins, and 
  * give external users access to Sage near-real-time sensor data.


### Requirements:
Publish/Subscribe model for data access


### Milestones:
  * Evaluate existing streaming frameworks
      - consider: ease of use, efficiency, amount of data
  * Implement draft (internal users only)
  * Testing in context of SLT
  * Make accessible to external users
